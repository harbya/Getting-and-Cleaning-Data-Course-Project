#Getting and Cleaning Data Project

## run_analysis.R


The run_analysis.R script performs the following tasks:


* --Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* --Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* --Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* --Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* -- Creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
